# Mel-s-Chess-Game
The traditional game of chess implemented through Python and Pygame.
For the time being, the game will have a PvP (Player v Player) game mode with future intentions of implementing an AI bot to play against.
This is a solo project that I have taken the initiative to begin because Chess is one of my most beloved games, so being able to recreate it is a good measure of my capabilities.
